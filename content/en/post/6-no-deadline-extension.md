We would like to stress out the fact that there will be **no deadline extension beyond March 9th**.

This deadline has been decided with a very tight schedule on paper revision process to be able 
to meet the full final proceeding deadline set by LREC-COLING conference. Hence, we decided to communicate 
on this deadline early, but we will not issue any extension at the last minute. Take this into account in your planning ;-).

We encourage you to submit your paper to the workshop.

**We invite submissions of original research that leverages both Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in any domain of Natural Language Processing or language resource development.**


## Workshop Overview

Large Language Models have become foundational in NLP, yet they continue to face challenges related to bias, hallucination, explainability, environmental impact, and the cost of training. Knowledge Graphs, in contrast, provide high-quality, interpretable, and reusable ontological and linguistic structures that support reasoning, fact checking, and knowledge preservation.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers working at the intersection of these two paradigms, exploring how explicit knowledge and implicit statistical learning can enhance each other. We welcome contributions that investigate, demonstrate, or evaluate systems, methods, or resources integrating both KGs and LLMs.

## Topics of Interest

We encourage submissions on (but not limited to):

### 1\. LLMs for Knowledge Graph Engineering

-   KG modelling, resource creation, and interlinking
-   Relation extraction
-   Corpus annotation
-   Ontology localization
-   Creation or expansion of linguistic or knowledge graphs
-   KG querying and question answering
    
### 2\. Knowledge Graphs for Large Language Models

-   Using linguistic or knowledge graphs as training data
-   Fine-tuning LLMs using linked linguistic (meta)data
-   Knowledge/linguistic graph embeddings
-   KGs for model explainability, provenance, and source attribution
-   Neural models for under-resourced languages
-   KG-augmented RAG (KG-RAG)    

### 3\. Joint Use of KGs and LLMs in Applications

-   Combined KG–LLM use cases with structured linguistic data
-   Digital humanities applications
-   Question answering over graph data
-   Fake news and misinformation detection
-   Educational applications and assisted learning
-   Visualizing academic writing with KGs and LLMs
-   KG-enhanced chatbots for health and medical contexts

### Application Domains

All application domains are welcome (Digital Humanities, FinTech, Linguistics, Education, Cybersecurity, etc.) as long as the work uses both Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models.

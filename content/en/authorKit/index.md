## Authors kit

***The LREC-COLING template MUST be used for your submission(s)***. If not, your submission(s) will be rejected.

[Visit COLING-LREC Author’s Kit Page](https://lrec-coling-2024.org/authors-kit/)

## Paper submission

Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system via the link:

[DLnLD Softconf link](https://softconf.com/lrec-coling2024/dlnld2024/)

All papers must follow the LREC-COLING 2024 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded from the Style Files and Formatting page provided on the website. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

## Author Responsibilities

Papers must be of original, previously-unpublished work. Papers must **not** be anonymized. Submissions thus must include authors’ names and affiliations. 

<!--The submissions should also avoid links to non-anonymized repositories: the code should be either submitted as supplementary material in the final version of the paper, or as a link to an anonymized repository (e.g., Anonymous GitHub or Anonym Share). Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.-->

<!-- If the paper is available as a preprint, this must be indicated on the submission form but not in the paper itself. In addition, DLnLD 2024 workshop will follow the same policy as ACL conferences establishing an anonymity period during which non-anonymous posting of preprints is not allowed.

More specifically, direct submissions to DLnLD 2024 workshop may not be made available online (e.g. via a preprint server) in a non-anonymized form after September 22, 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (for arXiv, note that this refers to submission time).-->

Reviewers are instructed to not rate papers down for not citing recent preprints. Authors are asked to cite published versions of papers instead of preprint versions when possible.

Papers that have been or will be under consideration for other venues at the same time must be declared at submission time. If a paper is accepted for publication at DLnLD 2024 workshop, it must be immediately withdrawn from other venues. If a paper under review at DLnLD 2024 workshop is accepted elsewhere and authors intend to proceed there, the DLnLD 2024 workshop chairs must be notified immediately

## Ethics Statement

We encourage all authors submitting to LREC-COLING 2024 to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of their work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references. The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit (8 pages).

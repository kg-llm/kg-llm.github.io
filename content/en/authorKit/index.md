## Authors kit

***The LREC template MUST be used for your submission(s)***. If not, your submission(s) will be rejected.

[Visit LREC Author’s Kit Page](https://lrec2026.info/authors-kit/)

## Paper submission

Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system via the link:

[KG & LLM Softconf link](https://softconf.com/lrec2026/KGLLM/)

All papers must follow the LREC 2026 article format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded from the Style Files and Formatting page provided on the website. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

Please be aware that some information in the style file pertain to LREC 2026 submissions (e.g. short/long paper size) but are irrelevant for the KG & LLM workshop (only one paper size).

## Author Responsibilities

Papers must be of original, previously-unpublished work. Papers must be anonymized. 

The submissions should also avoid links to non-anonymized repositories: the code should be either submitted as supplementary material in the final version of the paper, or as a link to an anonymized repository (e.g., Anonymous GitHub or Anonym Share). Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

<!-- If the paper is available as a preprint, this must be indicated on the submission form but not in the paper itself. In addition, KG &amp; LLM 2026 workshop will follow the same policy as ACL conferences establishing an anonymity period during which non-anonymous posting of preprints is not allowed.

More specifically, direct submissions to KG &amp; LLM 2026 workshop may not be made available online (e.g. via a preprint server) in a non-anonymized form after September 22, 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (for arXiv, note that this refers to submission time).-->

Reviewers are instructed to not rate papers down for not citing recent preprints. Authors are asked to cite published versions of papers instead of preprint versions when possible.

Papers that have been or will be under consideration for other venues at the same time must be declared at submission time. If a paper is accepted for publication at KG &amp; LLM 2026 workshop, it must be immediately withdrawn from other venues. If a paper under review at KG &amp; LLM 2026 workshop is accepted elsewhere and authors intend to proceed there, the KG &amp; LLM 2026 workshop chairs must be notified immediately.

## Ethics Statement

We encourage all authors submitting to KG &amp; LLM 2026 to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of their work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references. The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit (8 pages).

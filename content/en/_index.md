**Large Language Models** have become foundational in NLP, yet they continue to face challenges related to bias, hallucination, explainability, environmental impact, and the cost of training. **Knowledge Graphs**, in contrast, provide high-quality, interpretable, and reusable ontological and linguistic structures that support reasoning, fact checking, and knowledge preservation.

We invite submissions of original research that leverages **both Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs)** in any domain of Natural Language Processing or language resource development.

KG & LLM Workshop will be a full day workshop, taking place during the pre-conference and post-conference days, **11-12 May 2026** and **16 May 2026** in Palma de Mallorca, Spain, at the[LREC 2026](https://lrec2026.info) conference venue.
